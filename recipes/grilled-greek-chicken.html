            <p>The secret to this simple grilled chicken is a very powerful marinade
            featuring garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and vinegar
            'roasting' it slowly over semi-indirect heat on the grill</p>
        </h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cloves garlic (or more to taste), crushed or very finely minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>6 chicken leg quarters</li>
            <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Whisk garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper, lemon juice, olive oil, and vinegar together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Make 2 slashes on the skin side down to the bone in the thigh section and 1 in the leg section of each leg quarter.<br>
                This will help infuse pieces with marinade and allow faster cooking on the grill.<br>
                Season both sides of chicken generously with kosher salt.<br>
                Transfer to bowl with marinade and thoroughly coat all sides.<br>
                Cover and marinate in refrigerator 4 to 12 hours.</p></li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to paper-towel-lined sheet pan to drain slightly.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Place leg quarters on grill skin side down over semi-direct heat (avoid intense direct heat so chicken cooks evenly and skin doesn't burn).<br>
                Cook 6 or 7 minutes.<br>
                Turn chicken and cook another 6 to 7 minutes.<br>
                Continue cooking and turning until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 more minutes.<br>
                Serve with lemon wedges.</p></li>
